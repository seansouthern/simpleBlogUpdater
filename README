This is a simple convenience app for myself that presents a text box 
for me to compose a blog post in and a button that publishes what's 
in the box. It uses the Paramiko lib for SFTP, Beautiful Soup for 
HTML parsing, and Tkinter for the GUI. If you'd like to adapt this to 
your own purpose go ahead.

The code that I have written here is all in the public domain.
